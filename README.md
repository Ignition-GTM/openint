## Why do I need Venice?

🐌 Every fintech (& countless non-fintechs) **unintentionally builds a data engineering 
company**. Along the way, everyone runs into the same massive headaches:

- disparate data sources & schemas to try and unify
- complex data pipelines & API upgrades to build & maintain
- unreliable infrastructure because your focus is on business logic
- data cleaning & enrichment, if you have any time left over that is

These add massive risk & cost to all (especially to your customers if you're slow to launch).

🚀😍💰 Startups should launch & validate quickly, not reinvent the wheel. That's where Venice comes in.

## What is Venice?

**Venice is building open source infrastructure to enable the frictionless movement 
of financial data.** [Sign up](https://app.venice.is) to get financial data in minutes.

Our first product is a fully hosted backend with an integrated Plaid data pipeline 
that enables developers (frontend devs / no code tools / data analysts) to build 
fintech apps or internal tools in a weekend, saving them months of effort and cost. 

We're building a future where developers can leave the hard stuff to us (data 
engineering, enrichment, pipelines, normalization/unification, APIs, db admin, 
security) and focus exclusively on de-risking their startups with great user 
experiences & biz model + distribution innovation.

> Simple things should be simple, but complex things should be possible.

Never want to touch code? We support that. Want to dive deep into GraphQL or add a
custom pipeline into or out of Venice? We also support (& encourage) that!

Let us handle the hard data engineering & complexity of sync pipelines across 
thousands of financial institutions and data sources. We're here to give you &
your customers superpowers and make building one-off infrastructure a thing of the 
past. Your customer's data will always be unified, standardized, and up-to-date.

Here's who uses Venice:
- **Startups** use Venice to collect customer-permissioned data to make informed
decisions faster on underwriting & credit worthiness, aggregate financial data,
and automate accounting for your customers.
- **Developers** use Venice to avoid recreating the wheel by building all your
own financial data infrastructure. Easily add new integrations in a weekend,
not months, so you can ship faster.
- **Data analysts** use Venice to consolidate revenue & reporting into a unified database, 
while easily piping it out to dashboards.
- **Personal finance geeks** use Venice to keep your spreadsheets up-to-date, build more wealth, and 
retire faster.

And what they're building:
- Customer-permissioned data integrations (e.g. collect accounting info)
- Credit risk / underwriting tools 
- Personal finance apps (build your own Mint.com in a weekend!)
- Internal team dashboards using Mode or Redash
- Internal apps using no-code platforms like Retool or Bubble
- Financial reports using custom Python scripts
- Internal team expense & forecasting apps

## Who is Venice for?

You, probably. Venice supports a large variety of use cases, whether you're a 
developer, data analyst, no-code dev, finance geek, data scientist, accountant, 
small business owner, etc... we're here to help you get your data from A to B in 
a simple, unified way.

## Custom integrations

Venice already supports thousands of financial institutions (banks, investment 
accounts, etc.) out-of-the-box, but our platform's flexibility doesn't end there.

Venice can help build custom integrations to pipe data into Venice 
from a financial data source of your choosing. 
This allows you to easily integrate your existing data source needs with Venice and 
make use of Venice's unified and standardized data engineering & infrastructure
to do all the heavy lifting.

Your can request custom integration pipelines by contacting [Venice's support 
team](mailto:hi@venice.is) and providing information about the data source you 
want access to. Venice's team will then work with you to build a custom integration 
pipeline to suit your needs.

Custom integration pipelines can be set up for specific data sources such as 
accounting software, banking data, or payment gateways, and can be scheduled to 
run at specific intervals, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.

We're on your team, so you can relax and do what you love best while we handle all the
hard stuff.

### Examples

- Importing from accounting software (Quickbooks, Xero, etc)
- Exporting to your own database
- Importing from payments providers (Stripe, Paypal, etc.)
- Importing from commerce software (Shopify) 

## Looking for self-hosting?

As an open source infrastructure platform, Venice works just as great in enterprise
environments as it does for startups building from day 1. [Reach out](mailto:hi@venice.is)
and let's work together on getting you launched faster!

## How do I contribute?

Jump into our [documentation](https://docs.venice.is) and learn how you can easily 
extend Venice to add new financial data pipelines into Venice.
