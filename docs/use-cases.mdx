## Powerful ways to use Venice

With Venice's unified financial database, you can easily connect all of your 
company's financial accounts from various institutions into a standardized data 
model. This provides real-time, accurate financial data for analyzing revenue, 
invoices, and overall fiscal performance & trends.

By plugging directly into Venice's SQL layer, you can use your favorite tools

interactive visualizations and dashboards to share with stakeholders.

Venice eliminates the need for manual data entry so you can spend time making 
well-informed decisions & generating rich, up-to-date reports for colleagues.

<Card title="Access data from Google Sheets or via CSV" icon="file-csv">
  Say goodbye to manual copy/paste errors and never lose sleep over keeping 
  spreadsheets up-to-date again.
</Card>

Venice comes with CSV exporting out-of-the-box for any queries you generate.
Need to filter transactions by vendor? Done! Need to see overall account balance
or burn rate? Easily create a separate query and export the data on a continuous 
basis.

There is a little known feature in Google Sheets that will change the way you 
work with your financial data: the [IMPORTDATA](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093335?hl=en&ref_topic=9199554)
function. Easily & automatically export your unified financial data from Venice 
and back into your spreadsheets for whichever queries you can dream up.

Here's how it works:

1. Connect all your various accounts across different financial institutions 
& let Venice do the hard work of standardizing & unifying the data.
2. Go into Google Sheets and copy/paste the CSV export link from within your
Venice dashboard:

```excel-formula Google Sheets (spreadsheet formula)
=IMPORTDATA("venice.is/api/sql?format=csv&q=SELECT data, amount FROM transaction")
```

3. Say goodbye to the headache of manually inputting financial data into 
spreadsheets, and hello to real-time, accurate financial data at your fingertips.

With Venice, your data is always up-to-date and you'll drastically reduce 
common & costly copy/paste errors. There's a better way, and Venice is it.
