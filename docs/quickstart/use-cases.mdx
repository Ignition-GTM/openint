### How are they using Venice?

- **Startups:** Use Venice to collect customer-permissioned data to make informed
decisions faster on underwriting & credit worthiness, aggregate financial data,
and automate accounting for your customers.

- **Developers:** Use Venice to connect financial data to their apps to provide 
financial insights to their users and build financial tools such as budgeting 
and forecasting apps, custom analysis scripts, and personal finance apps.

- **Financial analysts and data scientists:** Use Venice to connect all their financial 
data from various institutions into a unified data schema. With Venice, they can easily
analyze a company's revenue, invoices, and fiscal performance, and make 
data-driven decisions.

**Venice is the backend for finance.** Let us build your B2B integrations,
so you can launch faster or even build the next Mint.com in a weekend. With raw 
access to Venice's financial database, developers can easily integrate rich 
financial data into your apps, giving you back months of time to focus on de-risking 
your startup & building user-friendly interfaces and features.

Venice works great whether you have years of coding experience or you're using
no-code platforms (Bubble, Glide, Retool) to build the next billion dollar company
or internal team tool. 

<Tip>Simple things should be simple, but complex things should be possible.</Tip>

Never want to touch code? We support that. Want to dive deep into GraphQL or add a
custom pipeline into or out of Venice? We also support (& encourage) that!

Let us handle the hard data engineering & complexity of sync pipelines across 
thousands of financial institutions and data sources. We're here to give you &
your customers superpowers and make manual data entry a thing of the past. Your 
customer's data will always be unified, standardized, and up-to-date.
