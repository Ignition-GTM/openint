## What is Venice?

Venice is building open source infrastructure to enable the frictionless movement 
of financial data. [Sign up](https://app.venice.is) to get financial data in minutes.

Our first product is a fully hosted backend with an integrated Plaid data pipeline 
that enables developers (frontend devs / no code tools / data analysts) to build 
fintech apps or internal tools in a weekend, saving them months of effort and cost. 

We're building a future where developers can leave the hard stuff to us (data 
engineering, enrichment, pipelines, normalization/unification, APIs, db admin, 
security) and focus exclusively on de-risking their startups with great user 
experiences & biz model + distribution innovation.
