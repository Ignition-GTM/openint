**Startups:** We get it, you need financial data without the risk. We're here to 
handle the undifferentiated heavy lifting for you so you can get to market faster
and focus on what drives customer value & revenue.

**Developers & data analysts:** Treat Venice as your unified database, piping 
data in & normalizing it into a unified API. Don't worry about creating schema connectors,
or cron jobs, or hosting infrastructure, or security. Let us be the backend so 
you can build the future faster; your customers will thank you.

  Stop recreating the wheel. The best API is 
  Venice's unified API with all the integrations you need built right in.

Don't lose sleep over the complexities of data engineering and scaleable
infrastructure. Focus on what really matters.

<Card title="Simply powerful" icon="magnifying-glass-dollar">
  The world is already built on GraphQL, now your financial data is too.
</Card>

GraphQL is one of the world's most powerful and commonly used languages to wrangle
data on a daily basis (2nd only to Excel formulas & SQL). Rather than force you to
learn yet another new way of doing things, Venice believes you should be able 
to access your data however you want.

Don't let the API stop you, with Venice you can generate powerful queries for all 
your data needs and use cases.

Everything is ready in your unified database.
