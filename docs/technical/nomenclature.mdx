title: Nomenclature
description: Speaking the same language

Venice tries to be as clear and consistent as possible with the nomenclature
used throughout the documentation and code base.

To that end, here's a list of what our primitives are and examples of how you
can think of them in use.

## Nomenclature

Used in a sentence:
A <strong>Pipeline</strong> simply connects a data <strong>Resource</strong> to/from Venice which transmits data across the <strong>Pipeline</strong> protocol, storing any data in Venice's unified <strong>Database</strong> and making it available via an <strong>API</strong>.


| Term                              | Description                                       | Example                     |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| <strong>Resource</strong> | A generic resource which can be used as a <strong>Source</strong> within a <strong>Pipeline</strong> (e.g. kept agnostic of how it is connected within Venice) | <ul><li>You authenticate your bank with Venice, and eventually can choose whether to read data from that resource</li></ul> |
| <strong>Pipeline</strong> | Pipeline moves data from a <strong>Source</strong> to a <strong>Destination</strong>, with Venice ultimately being the first destination we support | <ul><li>A bank account associated with a <strong>Resource</strong> is selected as a <strong>Source</strong> of data for Venice to pull from</li></ul> |
| <strong>Integration</strong> | A specific configuration of a <strong>Provider</strong>. | <ul><li>A Plaid integration configuring access keys, language, etc.</li></ul>
| <strong>Provider</strong> | Source code adhering to our protocol for reading or writing data into or out of Venice, including the schema for how data is transformed to be compatible with an external <strong>Resource</strong> | <ul><li>Plaid <strong>Pipeline</strong> enables Venice to read data from Plaid's API</li><li>Quickbooks <strong>Pipeline</strong> enables Venice to read data from Quickbooks</li></ul> |
| <strong>Database</strong> | The primary data store connected to Venice where all of your unified data is stored | A PostgreSQL <strong>Database</strong> configured to act as Venice's primary data store. <strong>Database</strong> can also be a <strong>Resource</strong> and act as a <strong>Source</strong> of data. |
| <strong>API</strong> | A developer interface into Venice's unified <strong>Database</strong> that can be called to read or write data from or to Venice | <ul><li>A REST endpoint which can return data from Venice in JSON format</li><li>A GraphQL endpoint which can return data from Venice in JSON format</li></ul> |

When we say "connect" in the user interface, we typically mean to create a new resource and setup a pipeline either to or from the Venice <strong>Database</strong>

{/* Maybe we should support wikilinks if we want to really define nomenclature well */}
